# Welcome to the Seed GitHub Repository!
Seed is an engaging AI text-based game powered by large multimodal models (LLMs). With simple prompts and open experiences, it provides a unique platform for interaction and learning.

# Why Play Seed or Call It a Game?
Playing ‘Seed’ gives the LLMs a game context, making the interaction more engaging and enjoyable. It’s not just about asking questions or getting information. It’s about embarking on an adventure, exploring different themes, and learning along the way. Another compelling reason to frame the interaction with the language model as a game is the consistency it brings to the model’s responses. When provided with a game-playing context, the language model maintains a consistent mode in its responses, enhancing the coherence and continuity of the interaction. This consistent context can lead to a more immersive and engaging user experience.

# Research and Development Discovery
‘Seed’ can serve as a platform for research and development. By observing how players interact with the game and how the LLMs respond, we can discover new ways to improve and evolve the game.

# Inspiration
